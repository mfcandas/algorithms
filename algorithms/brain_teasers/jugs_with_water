6.3 You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
NOTE: The jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly ‘half’ of the jug would
be impossible.


- fill jug3 and empty to jug5
- repeat again - then jug3 will have 1gl in it left
- empty jug5, fill jug3 with 1gl to jug5 (so jug5 has 1gl in it)
- refill jug3 fully, and empty to jug5 (so jug5 has 4gl in it)
